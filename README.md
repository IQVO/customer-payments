# customer-payments

Storefront (e-commerce) domain of the retail-network organisation, bounded context **Customer Payments** (Generic, storefront tier).

Moves money with the shipment facts: authorize at checkout, capture each shipment group's allocation when it ships, release on cancellation, refund on lost or returned packages, re-authorize uncaptured allocations before the provider's authorization validity expires [9]. Speaks to the payment provider through an Anti-Corruption Layer port (Authorize, Capture, Void, Refund, Reauthorize); the payment-provider-simulator is the stand-in adapter and swapping it for a real provider changes nothing else. Never sees a card number, only PSP tokens [11][12].

Status: under construction. The design lives in [warehouse-docs](https://iqvo.github.io/warehouse-docs/storefront/) `storefront/model/model.yaml` (single source of truth).
This repository is part of the storefront domain: it consumes the retail network's Open Host Service routes and its
published `retailnetwork.*` events; it never calls an in-org or restricted network route.

Runtime: Go, hexagonal, real PostgreSQL and Kafka only (`DATABASE_URL`, `KAFKA_BROKERS` are mandatory), CloudEvents 1.0 on every message
(`com.retailnetwork.storefront.customer-payments.<entity>.<Event>`), transactional outbox.
